# Welcome to Oleacia

Long before Gravitas was a thing, there were others that play with the Bioprinting technology. The first steps that finally allowed printing pods to exist was a bit more rusty.

This is their story, and how they survivied and thrived in thi oily world

# Oil as in "Olive oil"

In base game Oxygen Not Included, there is crude oil and petroleum,  two dirty elements that can overheat your colony to death.
What if oil was available as soon as your three starting duplicants were printed?

Oilpunk is a redesing of some base game elements, focusing on biological oils from second one. 

Biooil has several uses: from producing food to energy, from critter excretion to rocket fueling. The only thing for sure is that you will need a massive production to sustain your base!

This mod goal is to change gamplay in Space Out DLC. It will be compatible with base game, but asteroids are designed to provide an unique challegenge around oil.

Â¿What if i don't produce enough Oil? In emergency context and in some machines, petroleum also can be used. Expand your colony, but be careful with your resources!

# Technology vs Critters

Whatever path you choose, you can reach whatever you want. A XVIII century fabric which will power you to the temporal reach? Go ahead. A utopic colony based on clean sources, ranching and agriculture? Of course

# New opportunities, new dangers

Oil is very useful, but also can be dangerous. Burning oil is a fantastic way to power your base, but the extra CO2 pressure you have will not only have to be considered, but also produces contamiants that will pollute the air in your base.

Contaminants won't die in any gas, and have long lasting effects, so make sure you have some air filtering to protect your dupes.
